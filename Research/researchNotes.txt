App Name Ideas:
o	Eudaimonia (an objective standard of 'happiness,' based on what it means to live a human life well. Also defined as the condition of human flourishing or of living well)
o	SafeSpace (would be more fitting for a chat-based application)
o	MoodSpace
o	MindSanctuary (brought to mind after a long summer of playing Borderlands 3)
o	Turtle (associated with good health and a long life among Native Americans)
o	Sunflower (traditional symbol of happiness)
